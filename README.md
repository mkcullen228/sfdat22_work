* Finish any lab questions that you did not finish in class
	* Make sure everything is pushed to sfdat22_work if you'd like us to take a look
* make sure both requests and beautifulsoup are installed
	* To check, try `import requests` and `import bs4` both work without error while running python!
* Read this [intro to APIs](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/api-introduction/)
* Check out the National UFO Reporting Center [here](http://www.nuforc.org/) it will be one of the topics of the lab on Thursday

####Homework
* The first homework will be assigned by tomorrow morning (in a homework folder) and it is due NEXT Thursday (4/14)
	* It is a combo of pandas question with a bit of API/scraping
	* Please push your completed work to your sfdat22_work repo for grading

####Resources:

* [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/) allows you to explore tons of different APIs. Alternatively, a Python API wrapper is available for many popular APIs.
* [The Data Science Toolkit](http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/) is a collection of location-based and text-related APIs.
* [API Integration in Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/api-integration-in-python/) provides a very readable introduction to REST APIs.
* [Microsoft's Face Detection API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/face-api#detection), which powers [How-Old.net](https://how-old.net/), is a great example of how a machine learning API can be leveraged to produce a compelling web application.
Web Scraping Resources:
* For a much longer web scraping tutorial covering Beautiful Soup, lxml, XPath, and Selenium, watch [Web Scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iX0uxM1w8) (3 hours 23 minutes) from PyCon 2014. The slides and code are also available.
* [import.io](https://www.import.io/) and [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) claim to allow you to scrape websites without writing any code. Its alrighhhtttttt
* [How a Math Genius Hacked OkCupid](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/all/) to Find True Love and [How Netflix Reverse Engineered](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/?single_page=true) Hollywood are two fun examples of how web scraping has been used to build interesting datasets.
